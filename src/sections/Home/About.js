    <h1>I'm Jay! üë®üèª‚Äçüíª </h1>
    <SectionText>
      My love for software development began when I enrolled in cyber-security courses at my local community college. Having amassed 54 college credits prior to high school graduation, I continued to complete my associate's degree in cyber-security just one semester after high school. Following that, I pursued a more rigorous education at the University of Maryland, College Park. This journey culminated in the successful attainment of a bachelor's degree in computer science, which I complemented with a minor in Real Estate Development.
