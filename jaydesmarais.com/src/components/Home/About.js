        As a senior in high school, I started taking classes at a local community college to complete an associate's degree in cybersecurity. Having amassed 54 credits while in high school, I continued, completing my associate degree one semester out of high school. From there, I enrolled in the University of Maryland, College Park to continue my education in computer science, where I recently graduated with a bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science and a minor in Real Estate Development.

        Throughout my education and experience, I have touched a wide variety of fields within computer science. I have learned about full-stack development, algorithms, UI/UX design, cybersecurity threats and mitigations, and more! Although there is no specific field that I pull most of my motivation from, I find I thrive best in positions in which I get to work to problem solve and utilize solutions from across the many fields I have studied.

        I am an extremely dedicated person and put lots of detail into all of my work. I am constantly learning and enjoy putting any new knowledge to use in my problems or ideas, whether they are in my personal or professional life.

        After graduating from the University of Maryland, College Park, I moved out to Boulder, Colorado to get closer to the mountains, ski resorts, and a more active community. I am extremely excited to start my post-grad life in Colorado and I can't wait to see what opportunities open up!
